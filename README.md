## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daianaadepaula/streamify-video-calls.git
cd streamify-video-calls
```

### 2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
   npm run build
```

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

```bash
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
STEAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
STEAM_API_SECRET=your_stream_api_secret
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
```

### 3. Run the application in development mode:

 ```bash
   npm run dev
 ```

The frontend runs at http://localhost:5173 and connects to the backend at http://localhost:5001.
This will start both the frontend and backend on different ports.

## Scripts

- **Development**: npm run dev â€” Starts the backend server with nodemon in development mode.
- **Production**: npm start â€” Starts the backend server in production mode.
- **Build**: npm run build â€” Installs dependencies and builds the frontend.
